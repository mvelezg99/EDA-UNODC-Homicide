# EDA-UNODC-Homicide
Exploratory Data Analysis for the UNODC Homicide Statistics 2012 report.

I am conducting an EDA for the UNODC Homicide Statistics 2012 report which shows the information about the intentional homicide, number and rate per 100,000 population by each country and each year since 1995 to 2012.

I am making the EDA in Jupyter Notebooks; a notebook for each section of the EDA.
